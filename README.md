Fictitious sample data for an interview case

# Product Analytics Project

## Background
- Azure App Service is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) cloud offering used by developers to host websites and applications. The leadership team is interested in growing the Azure App Service business and wants a review of the business metrics before making strategic decisions. 

- Specifically, we want to better understand their **customer acquisition rates** and the **rate of customer retention** over time. This will help us understand which Microsoft teams and programs are best suited to help grow the business. 

- What information or findings do would you want to validate with the App Service product managers?

- **You** are the senior DS leading this project. In this time period you’ll work independently on a sample dataset to develop initial findings. In the second session you’ll meet with a PM and another data scientist from the App Services team. In the third session you’ll be able to present findings to leadership. 

## Datasets
- **Case_AccountData**: Identifies the segment category and dev language for each customer

- **Case_AccountCreation**: Identifies the start day and start week for each customer. Includes customers acquired between 2/1/2022 – 2/28/2022

- **Case_UsagteData**: Identifies each day that the product is used by the customer. Includes customer usage data for 2/1/2022 – 4/30/2022

## Task
- You have 90 minutes to develop your perspective of the App Service business performance. You can use whatever resources you want, like searching the internet, just like you would on the job. 

- A colleague is in the (virtual) office with you and is available to help get un-stuck and review draft outputs. They're seriously available to help if you want to confirm your approach or need help overcoming a hurdle!

- Final outputs: Code review and draft presentation of findings (slides or markdown file preferred) (25 minutes)
